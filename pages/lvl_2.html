    <h1>Level 2: Broken Authentication</h1>
    <h3>What is Broken Authentication?</h3>
    <!-- Need to remember to left align the text while keeping it centered -->
    <p>
      Broken authentication is gaining access to a user's account by inputting<br>
      the most common passwords. This is usually done via a script, where the<br>
      script will be given a list of the most common passwords and loop through<br>
      each password, attempting to gain access to an account. This is what you<br>
      will be learning to do in this exercise.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Exercise:</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of this exercise is to write a script that will loop through<br>
      passwords in a file and attempts to input each password until you gain<br>
      access to an account. Since there is a limited number of common passwords <br>
      and you should be writing a script for this exercise, we have generated a <br>
      password file containing 100,000 passwords with randomly selected letters. <br>
      You are still welcome to input each password individually, but we highly <br>
      recommend writing a script as it will save you hours of time.<br><br>
