Buffer Overflow

Required Programs:

        gcc and gdb, both should already be installed on any UNIX machine

Set Up:

        If a buffer overflow program has to be recompiled, you must use the following command to remove stack protection: gcc -no-pie -g -fno-stack-protector -o buffer_overflow [C file here]

File details:

        Exercise 1 - Buffer Overflow.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook that contains the student instructions.

        Buffer_Overflow1.c: Version 1 of the buffer overflow files. 16 character buffer with the useless_function on top for memory spaceing.

        Buffer_Overflow2.c: Same as version 1, but with a 32 character buffer and a slightly different placeholder if statement.

        Buffer_Overflow3.c: Version 3 of the buffer overflow files. 16 character buffer with the useless_function between break_me and main for different memory spaceing compared to version 1.

        Buffer_Overflow4.c: Same as Version 3, but with a 32 character buffer and the useless_function moved below main. 

Known bugs/Things to improve:

        The ability for the student to call the version of this stage from the Jupyter Notebook would be a good addtion.
