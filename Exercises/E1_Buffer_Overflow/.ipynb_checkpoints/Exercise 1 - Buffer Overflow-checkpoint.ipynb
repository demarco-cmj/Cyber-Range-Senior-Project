    "Now that you have your exercise number, head over to the Exercise 1 directory in terminal and go into the directory that shares the number you got. You should see the Buffer_overflow.c and buffer_overflow files. Take a look at the C file, if you have never worked with C before no worries! You won't have to code in C, and the file has been well documented. Why C? C has the function 'strcpy' which can easily be used to execute a buffer overflow attack which newer languages (Python, Java, C++, etc.) have fixed."

    "What is a buffer overflow attack? It is when someone uses a vulnerability to overwrite memory they are not supposed to. This can allow them to execute injected code, or gain access to parts of the system they are not allowed to access. You will change the return address of the 'break_me' function to get the program to print out \"What are you doing in here?\" In order for this attack to be successful, we had to compile the program with the command: 'gcc -no-pie -g -fno-stack-protector -o buffer_overflow Buffer_Overflow.c'"
