This is the working repository for the Cyber Range Network Exersise Development team. This will all be ported over to the Cyber Range git when ready.

The code for each individual stage can function as a standalone program and will need to be run by either the student or the server depending on the stage. This code can be found in the "Exersises" directory.

Code for the website pages is under the "Pages" directory and is linked to the index.html file that spearheads the website.
