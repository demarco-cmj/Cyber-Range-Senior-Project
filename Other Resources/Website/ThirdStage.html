    <h1>Stage 3: PHP Injection<br></h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Hmmm... This site seems to be secured, but is it? I bet we can inject some PHP<br>
        code that will print out the content of a file, maybe even the passwd file.<br>
        If that is the case, I have given you the layout of their file system for you to mess with.</p>
    <h2>Your Task:</h2>
    <p>Create a python script that will connect to the site, and inject a php file that<br>
        when called prints out the passwords located at /etc/passwd<br>
        Once you have made a successful script, push it to your Git repo, and the server will<br>
        give you the contents of the main passwd file that will have the password you need in it.
