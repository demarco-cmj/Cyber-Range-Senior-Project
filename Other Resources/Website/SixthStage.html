    <h1>Stage 6: Cross Site Scripting<br></h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>We're almost there! But this last stage seems a little more challenging, and I don't think<br>
    getting the password by stealing a packet will work on this one.<br>
    We need to get a little more sneaky. I know some site are suseptible to cross site<br>
    scripting, so let's try that.</p>
    <h2>Your Task:</h2>
    <p>This site is a fourm that allows people without accounts to post messages.<br>
        You will need to create a link that will allow you to get the user who clicks on it's session ID.<br>
        You can then use their session ID to access their account.<br>
        Once pushed to Git, the server will run the code, then click on the link as an admin on the server would.<br>
        This should then send the session ID to where you direct it to.
    </p>
