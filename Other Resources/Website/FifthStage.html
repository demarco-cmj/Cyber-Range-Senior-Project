    <h1>Stage 5: Password Cracking<br></h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Well, I got some bad news, and some good news about this site.<br>
    Bad news: I don't see any of the vulnerabilities we have exploited on this site.<br>
    Good news: Someone is constantly trying to access it. If we can get our hands on packets, we might be able to get their password!</p>
    <h2>Your Task:</h2>
    <p>You will need to capture a packet in transit and get the contents of it.<br>
    You will then need to use a password cracker to decypher the contents and then use it to log in.
    Press the 'Packet' button for the server to send the packet you must capture.</p>
